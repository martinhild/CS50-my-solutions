10.sql wrong number of rows

Check:
If your query returns a number of rows that is slightly different
from the expected output, be sure that youâ€™re properly handling
duplicates! For queries that ask for a list of names, no one person
should be listed twice, but two different people who have the same
name should each be listed.
