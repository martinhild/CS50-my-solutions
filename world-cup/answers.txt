Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO

I didn't have any predictions that turned out to be wrong. I was curious how many simulations it takes. so that each team is printed out.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO

After 10 000 simulations the results for one country usually differed by less than one percentage point.
I would call that “good enough”. (Depending on how high the fee would be and how often the program will be used in the future.)
